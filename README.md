<h2> About the project </h2>

I originally made this script for myself because I was training my skill for games like Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Valorant and I was using a program called Kovaak's Aim Trainer. 
On this program I've got a stats table at the end of every training course and for every course there was a distinct CSV file for it. So I decided to gather all the files and merge them all together so I could make a graph out of it to measure my improvements. 

At that time I was also researching on the web about data analysis because that peeked my interest so I decided to get all of those together in a fun little project :)
